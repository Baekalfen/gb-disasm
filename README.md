gb-disasm
=========

GameBoy ROMs disassembler.

Usage: gb-disasm.exe <ROM> -o <OUT_FILE> -a
<ROM> -> obligatory, ROM file to be disassembled
  -o  -> optional, disassembly output filename, default is console
  -a  -> optional, print assembly, default is print binary dump

It is not finished and could disassemble only parts of the ROMs binaries.
Didn't test it really on ROMs with MBC (Memory Bank Controller). Disassembly 
start address is fixed (0x100). 

Code is written in pure C but most part of code is autogenerated. Script (generator.py) 
uses opcodes table (opcodes.html) to generate parsing code in C.

To compile it on linux in src directory execute: gcc main.c -O2 -o gb-disasm

If you know why it's failing (I don't undestand GB working mechanism enought), 
please contact me at maciek.muszkowski@gmail.com.
