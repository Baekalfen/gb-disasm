gb-disasm
=========

GameBoy ROMs disassembler.

<pre>Usage: ./gb-disasm &lt;ROM&gt; -s &lt;HEX&gt; -b &lt;BANK&gt; -a -nc -nj
&lt;ROM&gt; -> obligatory, ROM file to be disassembled
  -s  -> optional, start address (PC), default is 0x100
  -e  -> optional, end adress (PC), default is 0x8000
  -b  -> optional, memory bank number, default is 1
  -a  -> optional, print assembly, default is print binary dump
  -nc -> optional, don't follow call instructions, default is to follow
  -nj -> optional, don't follow jump instructions, default is to follow</pre>

It is not finished and could disassemble only parts of the ROMs binaries.
Didn't test it really on ROMs with MBC (Memory Bank Controller).

Code is written in pure C but most part of code is autogenerated. Script (generator.py) 
uses opcodes table (opcodes.html) to generate parsing code in C.

To compile it on linux in src directory execute: gcc main.c -O2 -o gb-disasm

If you know why it's failing (I don't undestand GB working mechanism enought), 
do not hesitate to contact me.
